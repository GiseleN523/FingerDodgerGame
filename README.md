# FingerDodgerGame

This game was written in Winter of 2025 for my Creative Coding and Generative AI class. It uses the P5 Javascript library and ML5 Handpose finger/hand tracking. Turn on your camera and use your index finger to control the character at the bottom of the screen and avoid the bricks! Basic functionality based on ML5's handpose demo.
